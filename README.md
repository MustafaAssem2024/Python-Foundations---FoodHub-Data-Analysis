Project: Python Foundations - FoodHub Data Analysis

Project Overview

The FoodHub project is aimed at analyzing the online food order data to provide actionable insights that will help improve the customer experience and optimize business operations for a food aggregator company in New York. With the increasing reliance on online food delivery, especially among students and busy professionals, understanding customer behavior and restaurant performance is key to staying competitive.

Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

To analyze the demand for different restaurants and cuisines.
To identify key factors influencing customer ratings and order costs.
To evaluate the performance of delivery times on weekdays versus weekends.
To make data-driven recommendations to improve business strategies.
Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis contains various attributes related to food orders placed through the FoodHub app. The key columns include:

order_id: Unique identifier for each order.
customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.

rating: Customer rating for the order (out of 5).
food_preparation_time: Time taken by the restaurant to prepare the order (in minutes).
delivery_time: Time taken by the delivery person to deliver the order (in minutes).
Project Structure

The analysis in this project is divided into the following sections:

Data Loading and Initial Inspection:
Importing necessary libraries.
Loading the dataset and understanding its structure.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Checking for and handling missing values.
Exploring the data types and statistical summary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate Analysis: Examining the distribution of individual variables.
Multivariate Analysis: Investigating relationships between key variables.
Key Business Questions:
Identifying the top 5 restaurants in terms of order volume.
Analyzing the most popular cuisines during weekends.
Calculating the percentage of orders costing more than $20.
Evaluating the mean delivery time across different days.
Revenue and Promotional Analysis:
Estimating the net revenue generated by the company.
Identifying restaurants eligible for promotional offers based on customer ratings.

Summarizing insights and providing actionable recommendations to improve business operations.

Key Insights and Recommendations

Rating Analysis: Approximately 38% of orders do not have a customer rating. Implementing a mandatory rating prompt before placing a new order could improve data collection.
Cuisine Preferences: American cuisine is the most popular among customers, especially on weekends. Consider expanding partnerships with restaurants offering American cuisine.
Delivery Time: Delivery times are generally longer on weekdays than on weekends. Increasing the number of delivery personnel during peak weekday hours could enhance customer satisfaction.
Revenue Generation: The top revenue-generating restaurants and those with high customer ratings should be prioritized for promotional offers and loyalty programs.
